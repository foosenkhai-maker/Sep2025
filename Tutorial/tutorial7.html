What chicken is best for chicken soup?
</h3>
<p>
For the best chicken soup, use bone-in, skin-on chicken parts like thighs or a whole chicken, as the bones add flavor to the broth, and the skin provides richness. Combining dark and white meat allows for the best balance of flavorful, tender broth and juicy, easily shredded meat. Alternatively, using a rotisserie chicken is a convenient and time-saving option.  
<br>
Best Parts to Use
<br>
Bone-in, Skin-on Parts: Thighs, legs, or a whole chicken are excellent choices because the bones enrich the broth, and the skin adds flavor and body. 
<br>
A Mix of Dark and White Meat: This strategy allows you to cook dark meat for a long simmer, which stays tender, while white meat (like breasts) can be pulled out and shredded earlier for juicy pieces in the finished soup. 
<br>
Backs and Wings: These cuts are great for adding flavor and gelatin to the broth, though they may not be the best for eating in the soup. 
<br>
Tips for Cooking
<br>
Cold-Poaching: 
<br>
This method helps to produce tender and juicy chicken for your soup. 
<br>
Consider a Whole Chicken:
<br>
A whole chicken provides a mix of dark and white meat and can be used to make a deeply flavorful broth. 
<br>
Rotisserie Chicken:
<br>
For convenience, use a pre-cooked rotisserie chicken and shred the meat for the soup, saving significant time. 
<br>
What to Avoid
<br>
Boneless, Skinless Cuts:
<br>
While you can use them, boneless, skinless breasts tend to become dry and stringy when simmered for a long time, according to Stack Exchange.
<br> 
Excessively Long Cooking for White Meat: To prevent dryness, remove white meat (breasts) from the pot once cooked through.
