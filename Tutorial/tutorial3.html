<font size=5>

<center><strong><font color=cyan>1.Find a good place to study</strong></font></center>
<p align=justify>
Finding a good location to study is one of the most <b>important</b> step to take before you start to study because if you <sub>don't</sub> find a good location to study you might get <sub>distracted</sub> by something and it will cause a <big>huge</big> <sub>affection</sub> when you are studying something and it would be <sub>hard</sub> for you to <strike>focus</strike>, so make sure to find a good location for your study session. You can find some of the location like library or your own room to study as long as it <sub>does not</sub> have any <sub>distraction</sub> when you study.

<center><font color=cyan><strong>2.take a break</strong></font></center>
<p align=justify>
Studying too <big>long</big> might <sub>affect</sub> your brain memory because your brain <sub>can't</sub> consume <big>everything</big> and if you keep <sub>forcing</sub> yourself to continue studying <big>everything</big> after you have been studying for a <big>long hour</big>, it would be <sub>hard</sub> for you to memorize <big>everything</big> because your brain is <sub>tired</sub>. That is why you <sub>can't</sub> <strike>study</strike> for so <big>long</big> and you need to take a break to let your brain rest in order to study <b>more</b> things, so make sure to give yourself a break at least half or one hour.
<br>
<hr>
<center><font color=cyan><strong>3.Study with a group</strong></font></center>
<p align=justify>
Study <b>alone</b> is <sub>not</sub> <strike>wrong</strike> but it would be <b>better</b> if you have a <big>group</big> to study <big>together</big> because it will make you understand <b>more</b> and <big>fast</big>, some of the people in the <big>group</big> might understand what you <sub>don't</sub> understand, so asking them would be <b>easier</b> than you go find those informations by <big>yourself</big> and it <b>saves</b> you more time.
<br>
<hr>
<center><font color=cyan><strong>4.Reward yourself</strong></font></center>
<p align=justify>
There's a lot of way to make study <b>more</b> <big>interesting</big> and one of the way is reward <big>yourself</big> after you finished your study. It can make you feel <big>joy</big> and also <big>satisfied</big> and the reward that you give to <big>yourself</big> after you finished your study would be <b>meaningful</b> for you just like you just finished an important mission and you got something <big>special</big>. you could reward <big>yourself</big> by buying a food, drink, or an item for <big>yourself</big>. This way, you <sub>won't</sub> feel <strike>empty</strike> after you finished your study.
